# Brenden's GNU/Linux Dotfiles

These are my desktop config files, I try to keep my programs minimal and functional. Most of my machines run [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org), but everything here should be distro-independant.

## Programs configured in this repo

+ i3 (i3-gaps-git)
+ Programs relying on Xresources (st and colors)
+ vim/neovim
+ vifm
+ bash
+ moc (currently unconfigured)
+ tmux (currently unconfigured, base config from [LukeSmithxyz](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice))
+ fcitx
+ blugon
+ dmenu/dmenu-frecency
+ htop
+ polybar
+ compton
+ As well as just a few scrips in ~/.scripts

The full program list that I use is included in this repo as the 'pacman -Q' file, you can dif this with your own list of programs. Not all of them are dependencies, but are incuded anyway.
