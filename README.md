# Brenden's Linux Dotfiles

These are my desktop config files, I try to keep my programs minimal and functional. I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), but everything here should be distro-independant.

## Programs configured in this repo

+ i3 (Currently unused, will be later repurposed for Sway)
+ neovim
+ vifm
+ zsh
+ Xresources (Carry-over from old X11 config. Useful with colors scripts)

Some scripts are also included. Note ~/.local/scripts is for misc and unused scripts, and ~/.local/bin is in my $PATH. scripts from the scripts folder can be moved to the bin folder if you please.

Borrowed scripts and plugins are property of their developers. There are some hard linked plugins in .local/share such as: [fzf-tab](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab), [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), [ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale), [nvim-ghost](https://github.com/subnut/nvim-ghost.nvim), [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic), [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline), [vim-slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime), and [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki). At a later date these will probably be sourced from the aur.
